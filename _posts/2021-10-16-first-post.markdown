I have lately dedicated a good amount of my time to input but little to
generating output. Writing about what you learn is an efficient way to ask
yourself if you really know what you are supposed to know. Furthermore, it 
is very challenging to write clearly and concisely, and I hope I can use this 
blog to improve my brain's model parameters to write better.  I will mainly use 
the posts as annotations, probably editing and adding more information as I learn. 
The main topic is machine learning focused on graphs, where I have been dedicating 
most of my time.
