<h2>About</h2>

<p>I'm a software engineering student at Ontario Tech University and a research assistant at SAIN Lab, where I have been researching Graph Neural Networks. 
My goal is to work on interesting AI problems that can impact humanity in the long term.
Prior to that, I worked many years as a professional software developer for startups and big companies, where I developed strong programming and debugging skills. </p>
<p>I was also a fairly successful entrepreneur, founding a tech startup that got acquired by one of the XP subsidiaries (NYSE:XP).</p>
