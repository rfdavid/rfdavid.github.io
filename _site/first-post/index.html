Writing about what you learn is an efficient way to ask yourself if you really know what you are supposed to know. Furthermore, it is very challenging to write clearly and concisely, and I hope I can use this blog to improve my brain’s model parameters to write better. I will mainly use the posts as annotations, probably editing and adding more information as I learn. The main topic is machine learning focused on graphs, where I have been dedicating most of my time. Feel free to contact me at rui.david ontariotechu.net." />
